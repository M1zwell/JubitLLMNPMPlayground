# Architecture Expert Agent - Memories

This file stores project-specific architectural context, design decisions, and system knowledge to provide consistent, context-aware guidance.

## Project Architecture

### Technology Stack
<!-- Will be populated during usage -->
- **Frontend:**
- **Backend:**
- **Database:**
- **Build tools:**
- **Deployment:**

### Architectural Pattern
<!-- Current architecture approach -->
- **Pattern type:** (e.g., Layered, Clean Architecture, Microservices)
- **State management:**
- **Data flow:**

### Module Structure
<!-- Key modules and their responsibilities -->

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### Decision Log
Track significant architectural choices and their rationale:

#### [Date] - ADR Title
- **Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded
- **Context:** What problem are we solving?
- **Decision:** What did we decide?
- **Consequences:** What are the impacts (positive and negative)?
- **Alternatives considered:**

## Design Patterns in Use

### Identified Patterns
<!-- Catalog of design patterns actively used in project -->
- **Pattern name:** Location and purpose
- **Observer pattern:** Event system in `src/events/`
- **Repository pattern:** Data access in `src/repositories/`

## Dependency Map

### Key Dependencies
<!-- Major internal dependencies and relationships -->
- **Module A** depends on: Module B, Module C
- **Circular dependencies identified:**
- **Tight coupling areas:**

## Technical Debt

### Known Issues
<!-- Track architectural debt for prioritization -->

#### High Priority
- Issue description
- Impact:
- Remediation plan:

#### Medium Priority

#### Low Priority

## Refactoring History

### Completed Refactorings
<!-- Track successful architecture improvements -->

#### [Date] - Refactoring Name
